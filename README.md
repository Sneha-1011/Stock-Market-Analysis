# Stock-Market-Analysis

This stock market analysis project aims to empower investors by providing insights into market conditions and facilitating informed decision-making.

Focused on Bajaj Finance Limited's National Stock Exchange (NSE) data from 2015 to 2021, the project employs various statistical methods, including visualization techniques, moving averages for trend analysis, and return calculations.

Utilizing RStudio and the R Programming Language, the analysis leverages packages such as Hmisc, Psych, Forecast, ggplot2, and qcc. Key objectives include identifying trends in market stability, analyzing variations in stock prices and volume, and measuring daily fluctuations in the price, physical volume, and value of stocks. 

By exploring these aspects, the project aims to enhance investors' ability to strategically position themselves in the market, ultimately minimizing losses and contributing to the stability of the country's inflation.
